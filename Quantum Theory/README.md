# CNYT-2020-2
# Complex Calculator

This is a repository that has some different functions to perform some operations between complex numbers.

## New Update!
Some functions were included for modeling the basic of a quantum system in order to understand what happens with these systems when we do an observation, or when we just wait and analize what happens in the system.

You can find thse new implementation in the **quantumTheory.py** file, the instructions for using this library are in the information below.
#

The operations this library does are:

## For complex numbers:
- Addition
- Substraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Module
- Conjugated
- Convert from Cartesian coordinates to Polar coordinates and vice versa.
- Phase

## For complex vectors:
- Addition
- Substraction
- Additive Inverse
- Multiplication by a scalar
- Dot product
- Norm
- Distance between two vectors

## For complex matrices:
- Addition
- Additive Inverse
- Multiplication by a scalar
- Multiplication by a matrix
- Action of a matrix
- Verify that the matrix is unitary
- Verify that the matrix is hermitian

## For complex vectors and matrices:
- Transpose
- Conjugated
- Adjoint
- Tensor product

## Getting Started

- You have to clone this library for using it in your PC.
- Then you have to move it to the folder you want.



- Cloning the library

You have to write this in your Git cmd(If you do not have Git on your computer you can install it [Here](https://git-scm.com/))
```git bash
$ git clone https://github.com/FelipeAgPu/CNYT-2020-2.git
```

In this moment you will have the repository in your PC
### Prerequisites

- You will need to have instaled Python 3.8 in your computer

Here is a link where you can download and install it:

[Python Official Page](https://python.org/)

- Be sure you have the library is in the same folder of the project you want to implement it.

## Using the files

- For **complex numbers**:

If you want to use a function by your own, you just have to open the file **complex.py** and run it using this sintax:
```python
a = [3, 1]
b = [4, -1]
function_name(a, b)
# a and b must be arrays
```

- For **complex vectors**:

If you want to use a function by your own, you just have to open the file **vectors_matrices.py** and run it using this sintax:
```python
v1 = [[[a, b], [c, d]]] # Complex vector
v2 = [[[e, f], [g, h]]] # Complex vector
c1 = [i, j]             # Complex Number
function_name(v1)       # For operations with one complex vector
function_name(v1, v2)   # For operations between complex vectors
function_name(c1, v2)   # For operations with a scalar
```

- For **complex matrices**:

If you want to use a function by your own, you just have to open the file **vectors_matrices.py** and run it using this sintax:
```python
m1 = [[[a, b], [c, d]], [[e, f], [g, h]]] # Complex matrix
m2 = [[[i, j], [k, l]], [[m, n], [o, p]]] # Complex matrix
v1 = [[a1, b1], [c1, d1]]                 # Complex vector
c1 = [i1, j1]
function_name(m1)       # For operations with one complex matrix
function_name(m1, m2)   # For operations between complex matrices
function_name(m1, v1)   # For operations between a matrix and a vector
function_name(c1, m1)   # For operations with a scalar
```

- For **quantum theory**:

If you want to use a function by your own, you just have to open the file **quantumTheory** and run it using this sintax:
```python
observable = [[[a, b], [c, d]], [[e, f], [g, h]]] # Complex Matrix
ket = [[a1, b1], [c1, d1]]                        # Complex Vector
matrix = [[[i, j], [k, l]], [[m, n], [o, p]]]     # Complex Matrix
position = z                                      # Integer

function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ..., parameter_n)
```

## Built with
